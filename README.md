# Tic-Tac-Toe Command Line Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Command Line Game! In this simple yet classic game, you are the "X" player, and your opponent is the computer, represented by "O". Enjoy a quick and engaging match with the computer, and see if you can outsmart it!

## How to Play

1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
2. You are "X," and the computer is "O."
3. Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty spot on the board.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If the board is filled with symbols and no player has won, the game is a draw.
